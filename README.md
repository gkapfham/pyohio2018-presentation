# pyohio2018-presentation

This repository contains the HTML source code and additional resources for a
presentation that I, [Gregory M.
Kapfhammer](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/), gave during a panel at the 2018
edition of the PyOhio conference. The presentation's source code uses the
[Spectacle](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle) framework to control
the display of each slide. I have developed a custom theme for the slides that
manages the formatting, color scheme, and the use of photographs and icons.
